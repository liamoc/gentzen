Gentzen
=======

 Existing proof assistants such as Isabelle or Coq are geared towards large-scale, complicated
  verification projects, and are not ideal educational tools for topics of a fairly formal nature,
  such as the theoretical foundations of programming languages. 

In particular, they opt for a proof
  language that resembles a programming language, rather than the structure typically seen in
  pen-and-paper proofs. Gentzen is a simple theorem prover I am developing in Haskell, which will be
  tightly integrated with its user interface, using a structural editor for graphically presented
  proofs. This allows proof scripts to resemble pen-and-paper proofs, and assists students to focus
  on the proof, rather than the proof assistant.

Building

There is nothing much to see yet. The project will be cabalized very soon.
